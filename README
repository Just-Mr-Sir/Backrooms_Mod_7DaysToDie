TITLE
Backrooms

DESCRIPTION
This project will create a randomly generated Backrooms themed maze and survival experience in your 7 Days to Die world.

This project contains two important files. The first is the BackroomsGen.exe which is the program that generates the backrooms. The second is the BackroomsLocalPrefabs folder. 
This folder contains all the POIs used in this project as well as an additional RoomsData.txt file used by BackroomsGen.exe to generate.

Currently, the maze is made up of 7x7 (x,z) custom POIs. This can be restrictive to creativity of what "Rooms" I can include into the Backrooms.
My plan is to work on improving the program to support bigger and oddly shaped rooms.
In addition, any suggestions for rooms I should make and add to the Backrooms is most welcome

HOW TO USE
1.) Download the zip
2.) Extract the files
3.) Move all the files in the BackroomsLocalPrefabs into your LocalPrefabs folder (C:\Users\[YourUser]\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\LocalPrefabs).
4.) Open 7 Days to Die and create a new world. Be sure to remember/record what is used for world name (Ex: Hekofato County) and game name (Ex: My Game).
5.) Once the world is created you can exit the world.
6.) Double-click to run the BackroomsGen.exe, it should open a console window.
7.) Follow the prompts the console window gives until it states you can close the window.
8.) In 7 Days to Die, create a new world using the world and game name you used before
9.) Enjoy :)
